## NestJS or ExpressJs

- [Why I chose Nest.js over Express.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M8AYU_hPas)
- Gives you a predefined structure -> is opinionated
- Great if you want to enforce a specifi c structure in teams or you find yourself writing a messy codebase with the freedom ExpressJs offers you.
- Based on MVC pattern
- Encourages the use of modules, controllers, services, and providers to organize your code and promote modularity and reusability
- Architecture that is based on the principles of Angular

> I've decided to go with ExpressJs as I love flexibility and am convinced that I can keep my code base clean without a strictly opinionated structure
